## The Problem

**36.82% of AI skills have security flaws** ([Snyk ToxicSkills](https://snyk.io/blog/toxicskills-malicious-ai-agent-skills-clawhub/)). In May 2025, 170 out of 1,645 vibe-coded apps had security vulnerabilities exposing personal data. No specs. No tests. No review. Just vibes.

Every alternative is an instruction layer — Cursor Rules, Copilot Instructions, Windsurf Rules, CLAUDE.md. They tell the AI *how* to write code but never *what* to build, never *how* to test it, and never *when* it's done.

SpecWeave is a spec-first development layer. Configuration, not prompting. Enforced, not hoped for.

<br/>

## The Solution

```
You: "Build a checkout flow with Stripe"
  ↓
  spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md       ← you review the plan
  ↓
  Autonomous execution for hours      ← AI builds, tests, fixes
  ↓
  Quality gates (Grill + Judge-LLM)   ← code reviewed automatically
  ↓
  Synced to GitHub/JIRA/ADO           ← closed, documented, shipped
```

Every feature starts as a specification — user stories, acceptance criteria, architecture decisions — before a single line of code is written. TDD enforces correctness. Quality gates catch what tests miss.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g specweave       # Node.js 20.12.0+
cd your-project
specweave init .
# Then in Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or any AI tool:
# "Build me a user authentication system"
```

## Fork Enhancements

This fork adds four capabilities on top of upstream SpecWeave. All changes are backward-compatible -- existing markdown specs continue to work via automatic format detection.

### XML-Fenced Spec Format

Specs use XML tags as section fences with free-form prose inside. No DTD, no namespaces, no `<?xml>` declaration -- just clear scope boundaries that are easy to hand-edit and machine-parse.

```xml
<increment>
  <id>0042-file-upload</id>
  <title>File Upload Feature</title>

  <user_stories>
    <user_story id="US-001" project="my-app">
      As an end user I want to upload files via drag-and-drop

      <acceptance_criteria>
        - [ ] AC-US1-01: Given a file under 10MB, when dragged onto the
          drop zone, then upload starts within 200ms
        - [ ] AC-US1-02: Given a file over 10MB, then error displays
      </acceptance_criteria>
    </user_story>
  </user_stories>

  <error_handling>
    - If the API returns a timeout after 5000ms, show a "Retry" button
  </error_handling>
  <!-- ... 7 more mandatory hardening blocks ... -->

  <dependencies>
    - US-002 depends on US-001 (file management requires upload)
  </dependencies>
</increment>
```

The `- [ ] AC-US1-01:` checkbox pattern is preserved exactly from upstream, so the AC status manager and shell hook require no changes.

### 8 Mandatory Hardening Blocks

Every spec must include all 8 hardening sections as top-level XML tags. The validator reports ERROR if any are missing:

| Block | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| `<error_handling>` | Error states, retry behavior, user-facing messages |
| `<responsive_design>` | Breakpoints, layout changes, touch targets |
| `<accessibility>` | ARIA, focus management, color contrast |
| `<initial_states>` | Empty states, loading states, first-load experience |
| `<security_and_compliance>` | Auth, data protection, input sanitization |
| `<performance_and_capacity>` | Latency targets, throughput limits, capacity |
| `<operational_constraints>` | Runtime requirements, deployment model |
| `<anti_requirements>` | Explicit "must not" constraints |

Vague adjectives ("fast", "smooth", "nice") in hardening blocks and acceptance criteria trigger quantified spec warnings, nudging authors toward measurable values.

### DAG Dependency Validation

User stories can declare dependencies via a `<dependencies>` section. The DAG validator runs automatically during `sw:validate` and `sw:done` Gate 0:

- **Cycle detection** -- DFS-based, reports the cycle path
- **Missing reference check** -- dependency references a US-ID not in `<user_stories>`
- **Self-dependency check** -- a story depending on itself
- **Topological sort** -- deterministic execution order for `sw:do` task selection

The `sw:do` skill checks predecessor AC satisfaction before starting work on a story, warning if predecessors have unchecked ACs or open defects. Users can override with an explicit request for out-of-order work.

Dependency authoring guidance is built into the PM skill templates: direct-only edges, real technical prerequisites only, short chains (3-4 max depth), mandatory reasons.

### Per-Increment Defect Tracking

Each increment gets a `defects.json` with a 3-state lifecycle:

```
open  -->  fixed  -->  verified
(grill)    (sw:do)     (sw:grill re-run)
```

- `sw:grill` auto-creates defects on AC compliance failures
- `sw:do` prioritizes open defects over new feature work
- `sw:done` Gate 0 blocks closure until all defects are verified
- Defects are append-only with `DEF-NNN` IDs, linked to AC-IDs and task-IDs

### Per-AC Regression Tracking

Each increment gets a `test-manifest.json` mapping every AC to its test automation:

```json
{
  "acTests": [
    {
      "acId": "AC-US1-01",
      "automationType": "e2e",
      "testFile": "tests/e2e/upload.spec.ts",
      "lastRunResult": "pass"
    }
  ],
  "coverage": {
    "totalACs": 5,
    "automatedACs": 3,
    "automationPercentage": 60
  }
}
```

- Tracks automation type (`manual` / `unit` / `e2e`), test file, and last run result per AC
- Computes automation coverage percentage
- `sw:done` warns if automation coverage falls below the configured target (default 60%)

### Files Added

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/validators/dependency-dag-validator.ts` | DAG parsing, cycle detection, topological sort |
| `src/core/increment/defect-manager.ts` | Defect CRUD, 3-state lifecycle, metadata logging |
| `src/core/increment/test-manifest-manager.ts` | Test manifest CRUD, coverage computation |
| `src/core/types/defect.ts` | TypeScript interfaces for defects and test manifests |

### Files Modified

Key integration points (30 files total, +2853/-531 lines):

- **Parsers**: `spec-parser.ts`, `ac-progress-sync.ts`, `ac-embedder.ts`, `spec-splitter.ts` -- dual-format support (XML primary, markdown fallback)
- **Validators**: `three-file-validator.ts`, `ac-presence-validator.ts`, `completion-validator.ts` -- hardening blocks, quantified specs, DAG gate, defect gate
- **Templates**: `AGENTS.md.template`, `tasks.md.template`, `template-creator.ts` -- XML format references
- **Skills**: PM, do, done, grill, increment, validate, team-lead -- updated for XML format, dependency checks, defect/test-manifest workflows

## How It Compares

| Capability | Cursor Rules | Copilot Instructions | Windsurf | Cline | Vibe Coding | **SpecWeave** |
|------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Structured specs (spec + plan + tasks) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Quality gates (Grill + Judge-LLM + 130 rules) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Autonomous execution (hours, unattended) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Multi-agent teams (parallel, contract-first) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| External sync (GitHub / JIRA / ADO) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| TDD enforcement (strict red-green-refactor) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| LSP code intelligence (198x faster) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Self-improving skills (learns from corrections) | — | — | — | — | — | **Yes** |

Cursor tells AI "use Tailwind." SpecWeave tells AI "build a checkout flow with 5 acceptance criteria, test it, review it, sync to JIRA, and close."

<br/>

## Key Features

**Spec-First Planning** — Every feature starts as spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md. Configuration, not prompting.

**TDD Enforcement** — Strict red-green-refactor. Tasks cannot close without passing tests. Coverage targets enforced.

**Agent Swarms** — Run parallel agents across iTerm/tmux panes. Team lead splits work, each agent owns an increment.

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  Agent 1 (auth)  │ Agent 2 (payments)│ Agent 3 (catalog)│
│  sw:auto         │  sw:auto         │  sw:auto         │
│  ████████░░ 80%  │  ██████░░░░ 60%  │  ████░░░░░░ 40%  │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**LSP Code Intelligence** — 198x faster than grep, 0 false positives. Semantic references, definitions, and types.

**100+ Skills** — PM, Architect, QA, Security, DevOps, Frontend, Backend, Mobile, ML. Every skill is customizable via skill-memories without forking.

**External Sync** — GitHub Issues, JIRA, Azure DevOps — bidirectional, real-time. Close an increment, external tools update automatically.

**Enterprise Ready** — Compliance audit trails (SOC 2, HIPAA, FDA). Brownfield analysis. Multi-repo coordination. Multi-environment deployment.

**Dashboard** — Built-in web dashboard for increment progress, analytics, cost tracking, and multi-project monitoring.
